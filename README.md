# My Projects

I maintain[^1] several open-source libraries and utilities that can help you supercharge your projects for free:

### [ascii.js](https://github.com/NotTimTam/ascii.js)
A text-based game/gui engine that utilizes web workers and efficient logic management to squeeze every last drop of performance out of 2D canvas ctx.

### [file-converter](https://github.com/NotTimTam/file-converter)
A headless, self-hostable file conversion express middleware. Use the [GUI tool](https://github.com/NotTimTam/file-converter-gui) to quickly deploy your own file conversion server.

### [jtf](https://github.com/NotTimTam/jtf)
JSON Table Format. A file-format for spreadsheets stored in JSON, bridging the gap between popular spreadsheet file formats and JavaScript. Complex libraries are generally required to parse .xlsx files and their equivalents for use in JavaScript. It is even harder to export content back in to those formats. Formats like .csv are far too rudimentary and do not support things like styling and formulas.

### [flow.scss](https://github.com/NotTimTam/flow.scss)
Tiny SCSS framework for flexbox based layout structuring. Extensible and customizable. Useful for quickly structuring small webapps without learning extensive, bloated libraries.

### [console.js](https://github.com/NotTimTam/console.js)
A tiny, dependency-less package for printing pretty, timestamped messages to the console. Does the heavy lifting of color-coding and categorizing for you.

### [taskman.js](https://github.com/NotTimTam/taskman.js)
Uses CRON-like job scheduling to manage application tasks and prevent parallel runs of any task.

The projects on my GitHub profile I work on in my own free time, meaning development slows down when my workload increases elsewhere.

[^1]: I periodically revisit my projects to keep them updated and make improvements. If you come across a project that hasn't been updated in a while or is missing a feature youâ€™d like, please feel free to submit a well-documented, quality pull request. I also respond to detailed issue reports on my repositories.
